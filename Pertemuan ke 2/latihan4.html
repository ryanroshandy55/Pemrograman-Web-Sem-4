    <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languanges to Learn in 2022</h1>
    <p><div>There's no question that software programming is a hot carrer right now. 
        The <span class="red-text">U.S Bureau of Labor Statistic</span> 21 percent growth for programming jobs 
        from 2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the average for all 
        occupations. What's more, the median annual pay for a software 
        programmer is about $106.000, which nearly three times the median 
        pay for all U.S. workers.
        <br>
        Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, 
            companies, and types of software require knowing and understanding 
            different programming languages—and it's often beneficial to know multiple 
            languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be a 
            daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming 
            experience. 
            <br>The <span class="blue-text"><u>Master of Science in Computer Science Align</u></span> program at Northeastern 
            University is specifically designed for students who want to transition 
            into computer science from another field of study <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;"><i>"Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and 
            have them come out as software engineers,"</i> says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of 
            the graduate computerscience programs at Northeastern University—Seattle. 
            “We focus on math, programming, and <br>
            <i>a variety of computer science and engineering concepts.</i></div>

                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, 
            it helps to know 
            which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming 
            languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site 
            Indeed, the average annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use 
            and potential for growth.</div></div>
